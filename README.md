Small collection of _fancy_ components for the [lualine.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim)
plugin. The main purpose of this plugin is to simplify my personal lualine configuration. But if someone finds
this helpful or useful at all... _sharing is caring_ as they say.

## Installation

For [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
    "nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim",
    dependencies = {
        "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons",
        "meuter/lualine-so-fancy.nvim",
    },
    opts = {
        options = {
            theme = "seoul256",
            component_separators = { left = "â”‚", right = "â”‚" },
            section_separators = { left = "", right = "" },
            globalstatus = true,
            refresh = {
                statusline = 100,
            },
        },
        sections = {
            lualine_a = {
                { "fancy_mode", width = 3 }
            },
            lualine_b = {
                { "fancy_branch" },
                { "fancy_diff" },
            },
            lualine_c = {
                { "fancy_cwd", substitute_home = true }
            },
            lualine_x = {
                { "fancy_macro" },
                { "fancy_diagnostics" },
                { "fancy_searchcount" },
                { "fancy_location" },
            },
            lualine_y = {

            },
            lualine_z = {

    },
}

You will need a [patched font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) including the latest 
[codicons](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-codicons) glyphs. The screenshot was taken using
[Fira Code Regular Nerd Font Complete](https://github.com/meuter/nvim/raw/dd8f5d064321606e8a4b156e07b6f7413e2a676a/font/Fira%20Code%20Regular%20Nerd%20Font%20Complete.ttf), 
patched manually by yours truly and [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701).

## Components

- `fancy_branch`: same as `branch` but with different default icon.
- `fancy_cwd`: displays the current working directory. By default, the `$HOME` directory is substituted with `~`. 
  The default behaviour can be changed using `substitute_home=false`.
- `fancy_diagnostics`: same as `diagnostics` but with different default symbols.
- `fancy_diff`: same as `diff` but with different default symbols.
- `fancy_filetype`: same as `filetype` but with a small tree icon if treesitter is available and running. 
  The treesitter icon can be configured using `ts_icon`.
- `fancy_location`: same as `location` bit with a small red pin icon by default.
- `fancy_lsp_servers`: display the list of currently connected LSP servers and [null-ls](https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim) tools.
- `fancy_macro`: displays the currently recording macros if any (useful if one uses `cmdheight=0`).
- `fancy_mode`: same as `mode` but within a fixed-width section to avoid other components changing places when
  switching to/from certain modes (`len("NORMAL") != len("TERMINAL")`). Use the `width` option to configure the 
  width of the section (default is `3`). If `width` is smaller than the length of the mode, the mode is truncated,
  otherwise the mode is centered within the section.
- `fancy_searchcount`: same as `searchcount` but with a different default icon and without the brackets `[]`.

All components can be customized similarly to the ones provided by lualine (`icon`, `color`, etc.).
